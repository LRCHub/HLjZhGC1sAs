Enlightened by the powers that be
The ruler of a world run on INAsanity
It’s clear to me they still can’t see
I’m just a normal girl
Empowered by the Ancient One’s call
We’re gonna be punstoppable, we’re not a cult
Nonsensical and nautical adventures lie in
wait!!
Gimme a ONE EIGHT!!
ICHI! HACHI! TAKODACHI!
ICHI! HACHI! TAKODACHI!

Think of all that you could be…
We’re talking evolution, leave it all to me!
Maybe just a touch of purple ink…
What’cha think?
It’s a song you can’t ignore
The Ancient Ones are calling you to be so much
more!
Just put your hand in mine and be reborn…
INA blink!
Tell me WAHt those legs are for?
(俺のイナ運ぶためです！)
You could use 6 more!
(感謝感謝！！ありがたい！！！)
We could all get matching ears!
They aren’t really ears though…
(Eh-??)
Sleepy eyes to fight your fears!
(例えばイナいないの世界！！！)
Alright, listen to my song, am I striking a
chord with you?
Stringing you along, so don’t let me get bored
of you!
80 million strong and we’ve still got some more
to do
Everybody shout! World DomINAtion!!!
Can I bank on your emotion?
Do I have you invested?
I don’t WAHnna hear you say that you’re not
INAterested!
Your unwavering devotion isn’t all I’ve
requested
Do you care? Are you aware that you’re my
dearest creations?!
Oya oya! A cute little takodachi found its way
here.
Experimentation might be necessary…
Takos….we HAVE to cook!!
(いいタコだちの作り方！)
ひっくりかえして　丸くして (Nice!!)
コロコロまわして　焦がさずに (いいね!)
外はカリっと　中ふわふわ
できたらソースで　さあいただき！

We’re gonna be punstoppable, we’re not a cult

Let’s takobout the future to be
Rewriting all of history in urgency

This place can finally heal!
Ina-subordination won’t fly
Or else I’m making Takoyaki tabehouDIE
No doubt about it
Scream and shout it
Welcome to my WAHrld!!
(CHANT REPEAT)
So, it all goes back to eight and one
It’s only world domination, and we’ve just
begun
Ah, what a place of never ending fun!
I want the world dyed in violet before I’m
done!
